        <h2>Reviews</h2>
        <p>"I went into watching The White Lotus not really knowing what to expect. I just finished the second season and now know why it's had so many great reviews and won so many awards. What makes this show so good is the acting and the writing. Each character is beautifully written and acted, not a weak link on either season. HBO always puts out great content and this is no different. It's not a show for everyone but I definitely enjoyed it. It's one of the rare anthology shows where both seasons are equally as good.- Supermanfan-13"</p>
        <p>"I really hope she gets some award consideration love. Every single scene she is in is cringeworthy, fun, and full of depth. She's killing it!"</p>
        <p>"The White Lotus is so much better than I expected. Both seasons have all-star casts from top to bottom and all do an incredible job. I can't point that out enough, both casts are perfect. Also, the visuals on this show are just beautiful. This series has already won so many awards for season one and I expect season two to win just as many. It's both funny and serious in how it shows the difference in classes and how some of the wealthy and privileged live their lives. There are no real villains in this show but definitely some- Rob 1331"</p>
        <p>"Such an entertaining series and it gives you so many view points of life. It was also really funny and captivating. One can definitely learn a lot watching this series. Definitely a must watch.- Pirzadaj"</p>
        <p>"Beautiful sights, mystery and likeable characters. The actors are very well cast and each episode has me guessing what mystery might unfold as the season continues. I can't get enough of this show."
